# DynaWeather Dashboard

DynaWeather Dashboard is a React-based weather application that allows users to search for and view the current weather for multiple cities. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays information like temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions. The app also includes error handling and a user-friendly interface for managing city weather data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynaweather-dashboard.git
   cd dynaweather-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will be running locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

This project requires an API key from OpenWeather to fetch weather data. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variable:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
```

Replace `your_openweather_api_key` with your actual API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Usage

1. **Search for a City**: Use the search bar at the top to enter a city name and retrieve its weather information.
2. **View Weather Details**: Each city card displays temperature, humidity, and weather condition.
3. **Remove a City**: Click the "Remove" button on any weather card to delete that city from the dashboard.
4. **Error Messages**: If a city name is invalid or data cannot be retrieved, an error message will be displayed.

### Key Components

- **Header**: Provides the search bar for entering city names.
- **WeatherCard**: Displays weather data for a single city.
- **ErrorBoundary**: Wraps components and catches errors, showing a fallback UI.
- **Error**: Displays a user-friendly error message when data fetching fails.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management solution for managing weather data.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides real-time weather data for cities worldwide.

## Future Improvements

- **Weather Forecast**: Extend the app to show a 5-day forecast for each city.
- **Autocomplete for City Search**: Suggest city names as users type.
- **Favorite Cities**: Allow users to mark certain cities as favorites and persist them locally.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Handle specific error codes from the API and provide more detailed feedback to users.
